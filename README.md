# Power Electronics Lab - SCR-based Level Control

This repository documents a laboratory project on SCR-based level control conducted at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology.

## Report Sections
#### Simulation
1. Used Proteus for waveform analysis and simulations.
2. Detailed component functions based on graphs.

#### Protoboard
1. Assembled neatly, provided photos, and a short demo video.
2. Measured voltages for 15 potentiometer points.
3. Measured voltages and bulb brightness, created graphs, and commented.

#### Prototype Card
1. Soldered meticulously, shared detailed photos, and a short video.
